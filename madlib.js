// excerpt from a Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole

console.log(`A ${color1} hunting cap squeezed the top of the ${adjective1} balloon of a head. The ${color1} earflaps, full of ${adjective2} ears and ${adjective3} hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like ${pluralNoun1}. Full, ${adjective4} lips protruded beneath the bushy ${adjective5} moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with ${noun1} and ${food}. In the shadow under the ${color2} visor of the cap ${voteTrump ? 'Hillary Clinton' : 'Donald Trump'}'s ${adjective6} ${adjective7} and ${color3} eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at ${place}, studying the crowd of people for signs of ${adjective8} taste in dress. Several of the outfits, ${voteTrump ? 'Hillary Clinton' : 'Donald Trump'} noticed, were ${adjective9} enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything ${adjective9} or expensive only reflected a person's lack of ${pluralNoun2} and ${pluralNoun3}; it could even cast doubts upon one's ${familyMemberTitle}.`)
